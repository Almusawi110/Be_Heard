# Be Heard: AI-Driven Sign Language Translation System

## Project Overview
Be Heard is an AI-powered system that bridges the communication gap for users who rely on sign language by converting visual gestures into text and audio. It allows seamless interaction between sign language users and non-sign language speakers, offering multi-language support for global accessibility.

This project implements advanced machine learning models and AI technologies to:

Convert Sign Language to English text.
Translate English text into any chosen language.
Convert the translated text into audio.

## Use Cases
1. Sign Language to English Text Conversion
Problem: Sign language users often struggle to communicate with non-sign language speakers.
Solution: This feature converts sign language gestures into English text, enabling smoother communication in real-time.
2. English Text Translation into Any Other Language
Problem: Multilingual communication is challenging when speakers donâ€™t share a common language.
Solution: Once the sign language is converted into English text, this feature translates the text into other languages such as French, Spanish, or Mandarin using high-precision translation algorithms.
3. Text to Audio Conversion
Problem: In some contexts, text-based communication is not ideal, especially for the visually impaired or in social scenarios that prefer verbal interaction.
Solution: This feature converts the translated text into speech, allowing the system to communicate via audio output for enhanced accessibility.

Project Structure
The project is organized into branches for each use case, with relevant code and data stored in specific folders:

main branch: Contains core project files and documentation.
3 files are named on the basis of usecases and each file contains code for the respective usecases.

Sign-Language-Detection branch: Code for Sign Language to English Text conversion.
MultiLingual-Translation branch: Code for English Text to Multilingual Translation.
Audio-Output branch: Code for Text to Audio Conversion.
